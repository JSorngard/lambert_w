# Contributing

I welcome contributions from anyone in the form of suggestions, bug reports, pull requests, and feedback.

The only requirements on code style is to run `cargo fmt` on the code. Do not worry if you forget, as this will be caught in CI.
You may also wish to run the test suite with all valid feature combinations before submission as well, as it's faster to run those locally than to wait for CI.

Any added code paths are expected to have tests that cover them.

Also note that any code contribution will be dual licensed under both MIT and Apache-2.0 as stated in the readme.
