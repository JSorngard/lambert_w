Fast evaluation of the real valued parts of the principal and secondary branches
of the [Lambert W function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function)
using the [method of Toshio Fukushima][1]
to either 24 or 50 bits of accuracy.

This method works by splitting the domain of the function into subdomains,
and on each subdomain it uses a rational function
evaluated on a simple transformation of the input to describe the function.  
It is implemented in code as conditional switches on the input value followed by
either a square root (and possibly a division) or a logarithm and then a series
of multiplications and additions by fixed constants and finished with a division.

The functions with 50 bits of accuracy use higher degree polynomials in the rational
functions, and thus more of the multiplications and additions by constants.

`#![no_std]` compatible.

## Examples

Compute the value of the
[Omega constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_constant) with the
principal branch of the Lambert W function to 50 bits of accuracy:

```rust
use lambert_w::lambert_w0;

let 立 = lambert_w0(1.0);

assert_abs_diff_eq!(立, 0.5671432904097838);
```

or to only 24 bits of accuracy, but with faster execution time:

```rust
use lambert_w::sp_lambert_w0;

let 立 = sp_lambert_w0(1.0);

assert_abs_diff_eq!(立, 0.5671432904097838, epsilon = 1e-7);
```

Evaluate the secondary branch of the Lambert W function at -ln(2)/2
to 50 and 24 bits of accuracy:

```rust
use lambert_w::{lambert_wm1, sp_lambert_wm1};

let z = -f64::ln(2.0) / 2.0;

let mln4_50b = lambert_wm1(z);
let mln4_24b = sp_lambert_wm1(z);


assert_abs_diff_eq!(mln4_50b, -f64::ln(4.0));
assert_abs_diff_eq!(mln4_24b, -f64::ln(4.0), epsilon = 1e-9);
```
