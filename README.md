Fast and accurate evaluation of the real valued parts of the principal and
secondary branches of the [Lambert W function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function)
with the [method of Toshio Fukushima][1].

This method works by splitting the domain of the function into subdomains,
and on each subdomain it uses a rational function
evaluated on a simple transformation of the input to describe the function.  
It is implemented in code as conditional switches on the input value followed by
either a square root (and possibly a division) or a logarithm and then a series
of multiplications and additions by fixed constants and finished with a division.

The crate provides two approximations of each branch, one with 50 bits of
accuracy and one with 24 bits. The one with 50 bits of accuracy uses higher
degree polynomials in the rational functions compared to the one with only 24 bits,
and thus more of the multiplications and additions by constants.

This crate can also evaluate the approximation with 24 bits of accuracy on
32-bit floats, even though it is defined on 64-bit floats in the paper.
This may result in a reduction in the accuracy to less than 24 bits,
but this reduction has not been quantified by the author of this crate.

The crate is `no_std` compatible, but can optionally depend on the standard
library through features for a potential performance gain.

The API of the crate is stable and the only
reason it's not at version `1.0.0` is because it's
dependencies are not.

## Examples

Compute the value of the
[omega constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_constant) with the
principal branch of the Lambert W function:

```rust
use lambert_w::lambert_w0;

let 立 = lambert_w0(1.0);

assert_abs_diff_eq!(立, 0.5671432904097839);
```

Evaluate the secondary branch of the Lambert W function at -ln(2)/2:

```rust
use lambert_w::lambert_wm1;

let mln4 = lambert_wm1(-f64::ln(2.0) / 2.0);

assert_abs_diff_eq!(mln4, -f64::ln(4.0));
```

Do it on 32-bit floats:

```rust
use lambert_w::{lambert_w0f, lambert_wm1f};

let 立 = lambert_w0f(1.0);
let mln4 = lambert_wm1(-f32::ln(2.0) / 2.0);

assert_abs_diff_eq!(立, 0.56714329);
assert_abs_diff_eq!(mln4, -f32::ln(4.0));
```
