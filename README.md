# lambert_w

Fast evaluation of the real valued parts of the principal and secondary branches of the [Lambert W function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function) using the [method of Toshio Fukushima](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346309410_Precise_and_fast_computation_of_Lambert_W_function_by_piecewise_minimax_rational_function_approximation_with_variable_transformation) to either 24 or 50 bits of accuracy.

This method uses a piecewise minimax rational function approximation with variable transformations.  
It is implemented in code as conditional switches on the input value followed by either a square root (and possibly a division) or a logarithm and finished by a series of multiplications and additions by fixed constants and a division. 

The functions with 50 bits of accuracy use more switches for a finer split of the domain and more of the final multiplications and additions than the functions with 24 bits of accuracy.

## Examples

Compute the value of the [Omega constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_constant) with the principal branch of the Lambert W function to 50 bits of accuracy:
```rust
use lambert_w::lambert_w_0;

use approx::assert_abs_diff_eq;

let 立 = lambert_w_0(1.0);

assert_abs_diff_eq!(立, 0.5671432904097838);
```

or to only 24 bits of accuracy, but with faster execution time:
```rust
use lambert_w::sp_lambert_w_0;

let 立 = sp_lambert_w_0(1.0);

assert_abs_diff_eq!(立, 0.5671432904097838, epsilon = 1e-7);
```
Evaluate the secondary branch of the Lambert W function at -ln(2)/2 to 50 bits of accuracy:
```rust
use lambert_w::lambert_w_m1;

let mln4 = lambert_w_m1(-f64::ln(2.0) / 2.0);

assert_abs_diff_eq!(mln4, -f64::ln(4.0));
```
or 24 bits:
```rust
use lambert_w::sp_lambert_w_m1;

let mln4 = sp_lambert_w_m1(-f64::ln(2.0) / 2.0);

assert_abs_diff_eq!(mln4, -f64::ln(4.0), epsilon = 1e-9);
```
