# Enables the faster function versions with 24 bits of accuracy.
24bits = []
# Up to 25% increase in performance. Only enable this if the target CPU has support for fused multiply-add instructions, otherwise the performance will be degraded instead.
# Uses [Estrin's scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrin's_scheme) via the [`fast_polynomial`](https://crates.io/crates/fast_polynomial) crate. 
# While this results in more assembly instructions, they are mostly independent of each other, and this increases parallelism on modern hardware for a total performance gain.
