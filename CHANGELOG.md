# Changelog

This file contains the changes to the crate since version 0.1.1.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 1.0.10

- Moved unit tests to their own module.
- Corrected some information in code comments.
- Simplified `semver-checks` CI job.
- Made minor changes to the code of the plot example to show the
 function clearer in the final image.
- Note adherence to semver in this log.

## 1.0.9

- Switched the way the crate depends on the standard library such that the
 implicit prelude is always the same.
- Sped up CI runs by using `taiki-e/install-action`.
- Added an example program that plots both branches of the function.

## 1.0.8

- Fixed a bug where the principal branch functions would return NaN when given
 infinite input.

## 1.0.7

- Moved tests to their own file.
- Made the accuracy of the tests clearer.

## 1.0.6

- Added more unit tests that verify and showcase the accuracy of the
 functions also at the branch point.
- Verify the MSRV in CI using `cargo-msrv`.
- Check semver compatibility in CI using `cargo-semver-checks`.

## 1.0.5

- Added a "References" section to the readme and docs.
- Added a "‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top" link to the end of the readme and docs, just after
 the references section.

## 1.0.4

- Added the "No standard library" category to the crate.

## 1.0.3

- Clarified that we do not depend on a specific `libm` patch version.
- Changed the `rust-version` field in `Cargo.toml` to 1.63
 since that is now the MSRV of `libm`.

## 1.0.2

- Updated `libm` dependency.

## 1.0.1

- Documentation improvements.

## 1.0.0

- Removed the `estrin` feature.
 If it was activated anywhere in the dependency tree the crate became less
 accurate for all users without them being able to do anything about it
 (as the compiler assumes that features are additive).
- Removed the `24bits` and `50bits` features. Their only use was to reduce binary
 size and speed up compile time by letting the user skip compilation of parts
 of the crate if they didn't use them. However, the crate is small and very quick
 to compile, and the unused code should be removed during dead code elimination anyway.

## 0.5.9

- Added the `LambertW` trait that lets the user call the Lambert W functions
 with postfix notation.

## 0.5.5 - 0.5.8

- Documentation improvements.

## 0.5.4

- Added `lambert_w0f` and `lambert_wm1f` functions that evaluate the 24-bit accurate
 approximation on 32-bit floats (though the approximation is expected to be
 slightly less accurate then).

## 0.5.2 and 0.5.3

- Documentation improvements.

## 0.5.1

- Added `std` and `libm` features to match the features on the optional
 dependency `fast_polynomial`.
- Made the crate `no_std` with a dependency on [`libm`](https://crates.io/crates/libm)
 by default. The crate can be made to depend on the standard library instead of
 `libm` by disabling default features and enabling the `std` feature. This can
 result in a performance gain.

## üóëÔ∏è~~0.5.0~~

Yanked because 0.5.1 adds a default feature that hides previously included
behavior.
Therefore upgrading from 0.5.0 to 0.5.1 was a breaking change if the user
had disabled default features. By yanking this version the breaking change
happens when upgrading from 0.4.4 to 0.5.1, which requires an intentional
choice by the user, and wont happen automatically with `cargo update` as before.

### Breaking changes

- Removed the last underscore in function names. E.g. `lambert_w_0` is renamed
 to `lambert_w0`. This makes them easier to type and the new names are similar
 to the names given to these functions in libraries in other languages.

## 0.4.4

- Documentation improvements.
- Updated the optional `fast_polynomial` dependency.

## 0.4.2 and 0.4.3

- Corrected a mistake in doc information.

## 0.4.1

- Added the optional `estrin` feature that computes the Lambert W function faster
 on modern hardware by using [Estrin's scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrin's_scheme)
 to evaluate the polynomials in the rational functions.
 May result in slight numerical instability, which can be reduced if the target
 CPU has fused multiply-add instructions.
- Lowered the MSRV to 1.60.0.
- It is no longer a forced `compile_error!` to disable both the `24bits` and
 `50bits` features.
- Documentation improvements.

## 0.4.0

### Breaking changes

- Made the Lambert W functions return `f64::NAN` when given inputs outside their
 domain. This is in line with how it is usually handled in the standard library.

### Other changes

- Now exports the constants `NEG_INV_E` and `OMEGA`.

## 0.3.0

### Breaking changes

- Removed the `fast` and `accurate` modules and instead export the functions directly.
- Add sp_* prefix to the 24 bit versions.

## 0.2.6

- Minor documentation improvements.

## 0.2.5

- Corrected the domain bounds in the function documentation strings.
- Other minor documentation improvements.

## 0.2.2, 0.2.3, and 0.2.4

- Documentation improvements.

## 0.2.1

- Added github repository badge to `README.md`.

## 0.2.0

### Breaking changes

- The Lambert W functions now return an `Option` instead of a `Result`
 with custom error types.

### Other changes

- The `fast` module is behind the (enabled by default) feature flag `24bits`.
- The `accurate` module is behind the (enabled by default) feature flag `50bits`.
